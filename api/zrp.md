# ZRP (Zwoo Request Protocol)

The ZRP is used for Communication between the game server an a playing client. 

Its a simple protocol on top of WebSockets using JSON as data format.

## Definitions:

* **`Server`**: the zwoo game server
* **`Client`**: a player or spectator connected to the server
* **`Player`**: all players of a game (bots act as normal players)
* **`Host`**: a special type of `Player`, he can change settings and start the game
* **`Spectator`**: watches the game but does not participate
* **`Bot`**: special type of `Player`, its controlled by an algorithm. It can't attend states like Disconnected or Spectator.

* **`Message`**: a logical unit of communication between the `Client` and the `Server`, either a `Event` or `Notification`, can consist of multiple WebSocket frames
* **`Event`**: a message sent from a `Player` or `Spectator` to the `Server`
* **`Notification`**: a message sent from the `Server` to a `Player` or `Spectator`

* **`GameEvent`**: a domain specific event, like a player joined the game emitted by the `Server`. This will be translated into a ZRP `Notification` and sent to the `Client`.

Current Version: `5.0.0`

## `Message` Structure

```json
code,<data>
```

The Code is a number, used to identify the type of the message. The data is a JSON object, containing the actual payload of the message.

## General Types

### Roles

Every client has a role, which defines what he can do in the game.

```csharp
enum ZRPRole {
  Host = 1,
  Player = 2,
  Spectator = 3,
  Bot = 4
}
```

### Player State

The connection state of a client. This applies to `Players` and `Spectators`, `Bots` are always connected.

```csharp
enum ZRPPlayerState {
  Connected = 1,
  Disconnected = 2
}
```

### Card Color [v5.0.0]

All possible card colors in the game.

```csharp
public enum CardColor
{
    None = 0,
    Red = 1,
    Yellow = 2,
    Blue = 3,
    Green = 4,
    Black = 5
}
```

### Card Type [v5.0.0]

All possible card types in the game.

```csharp
public enum CardType
{
    None = 0,
    Zero = 1,
    One = 2,
    Two = 3,
    Three = 4,
    Four = 5,
    Five = 6,
    Six = 7,
    Seven = 8,
    Eight = 9,
    Nine = 10,
    Skip = 11,
    Reverse = 12,
    DrawTwo = 13,
    Wild = 14,
    WildFour = 15
}
```

### Card [v5.0.0]

A card is a common object, used in multiple `Events` and `Notifications`.

```json
{
  "color": <card color enum: number>,
  "type": <card type enum: number>
}
```


### Decision Type

The type of a decision, which can be requested from a player.

```csharp
enum DecisionType {
  SelectColor = 1,
  SelectPlayer = 2
}
```

### Settings Type

The data type of a setting.

```csharp
enum SettingType {
  Readonly = 0,
  Numeric = 1,
  Boolean = 2
}
```

### UIFeedback

**`GameEvents`** can trigger visual feedback for the user. This feedback consists of 3 integral parts: `type`, `kind`, `arguments`.

* `kind`\: defines which arguments should be used in which way
* `type`\: which feedback should be displayed
* `arguments`\: provide context for the feedback, like which players are involved

#### UIFeedbackType

```csharp
enum UIFeedbackType {
  Skipped = 1,
  DirectionChanged = 2,
  PlayerHasDrawn = 3,
  MissedLast = 4,
  DeckSwapped = 5,
  ColorChanged = 6,
}
```

#### UIFeedbackKind

```csharp
enum UIFeedbackKind {
  Individual = 1, // single user involved
  Interaction = 2, // interaction between two users
  Unaffected = 3 // no user directly involved
}
```

#### UIFeedbackArguments

The **core** arguments are the following, these indicate, that the client can safely resolve usernames from them.

* Individual: `{ `**`target`**`: <id> }`
* Interaction: `{ `**`target`**`: <id>, `**`origin`**`: <id> }`
* Unaffected: `{}`

Besides these, each Feedback Event may define **further** arguments, other well known one are:

* `{ amount: <a transferred amount of cards> }`

### GameProfileGroup [deprecated v5.0.0]

```csharp
enum GameProfileGroup {
  System = 1,
  User = 2,
}
```
