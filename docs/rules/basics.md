# The basics

## The game

## Base rules

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#basics)

At the core of the game, you have to get rid of all your cards. You can do this by playing cards on the discard pile. The card you play must either have the same color or the same number as the card on the discard pile. If you can't play a card, you have to draw a card from the deck. The first player to get rid of all their cards wins the game.

**But** there are a few twists: **special cards**. These cards can change the game in a variety of ways.

## Special Cards

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#basics)

### Skip

Playing this card will skip the next player's turn. The next player won't be able to place or draw a card. If there is only one opponent left (the last two players remaining), it is your turn again, and you can place cards back to back. 

### Reverse

Playing this card will reverse the current direction of the game. Instead of the player after you, the player before you will be able to play again. If there is only one opponent left (the last two players remaining), this card will have no notable effect on the game.

### Draw 2

Playing this card will make the next player draw two cards. There is no way of circumventing the punishment, you have to draw those cards, which is inevitable.

### Wild

The wild card is a very powerful card. Once played, you can select the color the next player has to place. You can use it to your advantage or to your opponent's disadvantage.


### Wild Draw 4

This card is a combination of the "wild" and "draw 2" cards. Once played, you can select the color the next player has to place, and the next player will have to draw 4 cards.

## Objective of the game

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#basics)

The main objective of the game varies depending on the selected game mode. In the default mode, the goal is to be the first player to play all their cards, or, in other words, to be the first with an empty hand.
