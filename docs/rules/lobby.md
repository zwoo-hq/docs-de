# Room customizations

Beside rules or the card pile, there are also attributes of the game room that can be customized.

Those are currently:

## Amount of players

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#lobby-customizations)

> Change maximum amount of players for your game.

Here, you can set the maximum amount of players that are able to join your game. Once this limit is reached, new players aren't able to join your game.

::: warning Attention
The maximum amount of players in a game is currently 20.
:::

Spectators and bots do not count against that limit. There is no hard limit on how many of those can join.


## Amount of cards

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#lobby-customizations)

> Choose the amount of cards each player is supplied with at the start of a game.

With this option, you can set the amount of initial cards a player will get at the start of the game.

::: warning Attention
The maximum amount of cards a player can get at the start of the game is 30.
