# Pile customizations

The contents of the pile can be fully customized in the "Cards pile" rule group inside the rules widget.

Inside this group, you can choose the amount of cards of a certain type that are inside the card pile. Because ZWOO simulates a real card pile, changes in the amounts will effectively change the probability of a card being drawn from the pile. 

Furthermore, this feature can be used to disable certain types of cards by changing the amount of those cards inside the pile to 0.

::: warning Attention
ZWOO will scale the contents of the card pile based on demand. This means that changing the amount of a certain card to _n_ will not guarantee that there are at most _n_ cards of this type inside the game at any point in time.
