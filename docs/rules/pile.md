# Pile customizations

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#cards-pile)

The contents of the pile can be fully customized in the "Cards pile" rule group inside the rules widget.

Inside this group, you can choose the amount of cards of a certain type that are inside the card pile. Because ZWOO simulates a real card pile, changes in the amounts will effectively change the probability of a card being drawn from the pile. 

Furthermore, this feature can be used to disable certain types of cards by changing the amount of those cards inside the pile to 0.

::: warning Attention
ZWOO will scale the contents of the card pile based on demand. This means that changing the amount of a certain card to _n_ will not guarantee that there are at most _n_ cards of this type inside the game at any point in time.
