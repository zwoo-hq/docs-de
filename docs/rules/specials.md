# Special rules

ZWOO offers a unique set of special rules, these are currently:

## Add draw amounts

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#special-rules)

> On top of a draw card, further draw cards can be placed. The number of cards to be drawn is added. You can put +2 cards on top of +4 cards, as well as +4 cards on top of +2 cards.

This rule guarantees fun games with your maybe-soon-to-be ex-friends. The twist of this rule is, that draw cards like +2 or wild +4 can be placed on top of each other, allowing the amount of cards to be drawn to skyrocket. Though, it should be used carefully since there is a large possibility that the friend who had to draw the tremendous amount of cards might not stick along any longer.

::: info Tip
The current amount of cards to draw will be displayed on top of the pile.

## Deck-swap

[\[back to the reference\]](./index.md#special-rules)

> When a player lays a 2, he can choose any player with whom to exchange all cards.

Are you ready for a game that turns 180 degrees in the last second? This rule is right for you.  Your friend is nearly finished, but you still have your deck completely full? Just place a 2 and swap your decks. Any 2 will be truly mighty, but be careful, you can literally gift someone your win when you are not paying attention.

::: info Tip
It can be hard to keep track of the state of the game with this rule enabled. It's recommended to enable [feedback messages](../games/settings.md) to increase clarity and reduce confusion.
