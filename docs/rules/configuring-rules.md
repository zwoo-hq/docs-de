# Configuring Rules

::: tip WIP
This section of the documentation is a work in progress. The content may be incomplete or subject to change.
:::

While waiting in the lobby for the game to start, the **host** of the game can change the rules. This can be done in the widget called "Rules". The current configuration of the rules will be broadcasted to all players so that everybody can see what rules are applied.
