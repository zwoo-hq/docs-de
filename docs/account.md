# Account

## Create an account

You can create a ZWOO account at [zwoo.igd20.de/create-account](https://zwoo.igd20.de/create-account).

For a new account you need to provide the following information:

- **Username**: your username must be unique and at least 3 characters long.
- **Email**: your email must be unique and a valid email address. It will be used to verify your account.
- **Password**: your password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one number and one special character.

After creating an account, you will receive an email with a verification link. You need to click on this link to verify your account.

## Log in

You can log in to your ZWOO account at [zwoo.igd20.de/login](https://zwoo.igd20.de/login). You will need your email and password to log in.

## Sync settings

While you are logged in, all your settings will be synced to your account. That means, whenever you log in on a new device, your settings will be automatically applied.

You can exclude settings from syncing by clicking on the `Cloud Icon` button in the settings menu. Or you can disable syncing completely by disabling the `Sync settings` option in the `Account` group of the settings menu.

The `Sync UI state` option keeps the state of the user interface in sync. This includes for example the state of widgets of the lobby or the quick menu.

## Delete an account

When logged in, you can delete your account in the `Account` group of the settings menu. You will need to confirm the deletion by entering your password.
